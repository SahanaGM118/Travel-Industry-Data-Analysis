# Travel-Industry-Data-Analysis
Data analytics is transforming the 

ðŸš€ Just wrapped up a  project in the travel industry by enabling companies to enhance customer experiences, optimize operations, and make data-driven decisions

The task was to provide insights to executive management by tackling 20 ad hoc requests using SQL. As an applicant for a junior data analyst position, I was tested not only on my technical SQL skills but also on my ability to communicate complex insights to top-level management.

Hereâ€™s what I did:
ðŸ”–Ran SQL queries to address the key business questions.

ðŸ”–Created clear, actionable insights to help executives make quick, data-informed decisions.

ðŸ”–Designed a creative presentation tailored for a C-suite audience, showcasing data in an easily digestible format.

SQL skills learned:

## 1. Introduction to Travel Industry Data Analytics 
â€¢ Data analytics in the travel industry helps businesses optimize operations, improve 
customer experiences, and boost revenue. 

â€¢ Uses historical data, real-time insights, and predictive analytics to enhance decision
making. 

## 2. Key Data Sources 
â€¢ Booking & Reservation Data (Flights, Hotels, Tours)

â€¢ Customer Data (Demographics, Preferences, Feedback) 

â€¢ Website & Mobile App Analytics (User Behavior, Search Trends) 

â€¢ Social Media & Review Platforms (Sentiment Analysis, Ratings) 

â€¢ Market & Competitor Data (Pricing, Offers, Demand Trends)

## 3. Types of Analytics in Travel Industry 

-- Descriptive Analytics â€“ Summarizes historical trends (e.g., seasonal demand, customer 
preferences). 

-- Predictive Analytics â€“ Forecasts future trends using ML (e.g., demand prediction, dynamic 
pricing). 

-- Prescriptive Analytics â€“ Suggests optimal actions (e.g., personalized recommendations, 
pricing strategies). 

-- Real-time Analytics â€“ Monitors ongoing travel trends (e.g., flight delays, surge pricing). 

## 4. Applications of Data Analytics in Travel

-- Customer Personalization â€“ Recommending destinations, hotels, and packages based on 
past behavior. 

-- Revenue Management & Dynamic Pricing â€“ Adjusting prices based on demand, 
competitor pricing, and seasonality. 

--âœˆ Operational Efficiency â€“ Optimizing airline routes, hotel occupancy, and transportation 
schedules.

FROM Travel
```

## 2. Retrieve all the distinct travel modes used by tourists. 
``` Sql
SELECT DISTINCT
     Mode_of_travel
FROM Travel
````

## 3. Retrieve all the distinct type of Accommodation used by tourists. 
``` Sql

   DISTINCT Accommodation_Type
FROM Travel
```

## 4. Display all records where the mode of travel is 'Flight'.
``` sql
SELECT *
FROM Travel
Where Mode_of_Travel = 'FLIGHT'
```

## 5. Count the number of tourists travelled to each country using different mode of travel.
``` sql

   COUNT(tourist_id) as No_of_tourists
FROM Travel
GROUP BY Country_Visited,Mode_of_Travel
```

## 6. Find total Tarvel Cost per person for different Mode of Travel for each Country. 
``` sql
SELECT
   Tourist_ID,
   Mode_of_Travel,
   Country_Visited,
   SUM(Total_Travel_Cost) AS Total_Cost_Per_Person
FROM Travel
GROUP BY Tourist_ID,Mode_of_Travel,Country_Visited
```

## 7. Find the top 5 most visited countries by tourists. 


```sql
SELECT
   top 5 Country_Visited,
   COUNT(tourist_ID) Number_of_country
FROM Travel
GrOUP By Country_Visited
Order BY COUNT(tourist_ID) DESC
```

## 8. List the top 5 most visited cities in each Country. 
```sql
WITH CTE_top5_Visited_cities As
(
SELECT country_visited,
       City_Visited,
	    COUNT(tourist_ID) as Number_od_trouist,
       ROW_NUMBER() over(PARTITION BY City_Visited ORDER BY COUNT(tourist_ID) Desc ) as RN
FROM Travel
GROUP BY country_visited,City_Visited
)
SELECT country_visited,
      City_Visited,

	   Mode_of_Travel
Having COUNT(*)<5
ORDER BY City_Visited, trip_count
```
